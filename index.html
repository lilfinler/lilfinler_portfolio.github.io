        <p>My drive begins with wonder. I am enthused by entertainment that brings me adoration for creating projects to gaze upon and ponder over. I initially was inspired by my love of animation and the way viewing it made me feel. I was baffled and astonished by the creation process of animation to be able to make such amazing flowing art in motion. I sought out to learn about animating and the skills required to produce fantastical picture essence. <br><br>I began my quest in taking courses that involved 3D animating even in architecture courses. I started with Maya, but I did not grasp an understanding of it until years later on. Yet, I was still fascinated by 3D animation which kept my drive for digital media alive. I then studied digital architecture for a year including: AutoCad, ArchiCad, Revit, and SketchUp Pro 8. I had not known about digital media as a major yet, so these were the only computer tech courses that involved animation in my area. <br><br>When I finally discovered and declared my major as Digital Media, I took courses in several Adobe programs that were very articulate such as: InDesign, Illustrator, Flash, Premiere Pro, and Photoshop. I enjoyed learning about all of these courses within Digital Media, but after all this, none really were similar to 3D animation from which I was aspiring toward. Of course, everything in digital media intertwines, however, my specific goal was not yet met. Nonetheless, I found my next passion in video editing. <br><br>After taking several courses at Cabrillo College of Santa Cruz, I moved back to my hometown in Walnut Creek where I wanted to further my studies. I began attending Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill where I was intrigued by the different teaching structure and diverse culture of teachers and their styles. At Cabrillo College, each digital media class were taught in the same exact format. I enjoyed the greater creativity and free reign that DVC professors promoted. While there, I continued to learn Photoshop, but its lack of animation lacked flow and was more similar to Flash than the flow of Maya I had once enjoyed. 
          <br><br>Alas! I stepped into the animation realm at DVC which had reignited my inspirations and feelings from the beginning of my journey. I had finally learned about what and how animation actually works and the history within it. I found out about the immense process in which animation is created; I was opened up to a vast new world of the entire process. I could hardly fathom the immense intensity of the art of animation. As hard as I workd in it, artistry by hand was very difficult and brought down my spirits. So I decided to revert back to the beginning of art where I learned my hidden abilities to draw, collage, and sculpt in courses such as: Drawing, Crafting, Pottery, Sculpture, and Photography. What just started as wanting to animate in Maya, I found my passions in Black and White Photography using film and Pottery using the wheel. I was lost in these passions for another year. <br><br>After all this time, from my introduciton to digital media through Maya, I took up Maya again. However, this course was nothing I knew, for this professor was actually teaching me how to build with structure and finally I got to animate. I love animating a sculpted form to look realistic. It is so amazing to me that my biped could brush its teeth and pivot its feet while running. This is what I had dreamed of from the beginning and I could finally animate in 3D space where I felt the most motivated.<br><br>As time would tell, it was time to move forward to greater advanced academia where I joined San Jose State University in the college of Humanitis and the Arts for my major in Digital Media. This place is the most difficult feat I have ever academically encountered. Even though animation is an entire major in itself, I feel I can bring myself to learn more about the practical arts of Digital Media, and not just solely animation. Maya is what I thrive on, but I have learned there is even more I must learn about in digital media since I have already come thus far as a digital media artist. I must learn the art of programming, and so far it is really interesting as unfathomable as it was recently. I learned that not only do programs intertwine with one another, but formats do as well and they can be changed into each other to portray its own art form as another form but still is its original piece. In other words, one art piece can be portrayed in multipled ways, such as the concept of images into audio. <br><br>While studying here at SJSU, I am learning css programming, finally understanding Photoshop for the first time, and audio through Audacity and Audition. To think the last thing I learned was audio editing, my third new found digital media love. I love working with audio and video together and one day I can make 3D animations into videos with audio! --All within my own webstie that I create. A place that is who I am as an artist for all to admire. <br><br>My dream is to create super rad digtal work in motion that is well created and enticing to view, so that my audience can feel awe as I have from those whom inspired me.</p>
